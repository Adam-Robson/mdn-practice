# 🫧 MDN Practice

This repository contains implementations drafted by the author. All exercises and projects are inspired by the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) challenges. They can be found on GitHub in the [learning area](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/), or at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

These projects are created as I read through MDN's literature, & apply what I learn. I experiment with variations where appropriate. All code was written by me, based on the material and content by MDN.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder represents a challenge, exercise, or lesson from the MDN curriculum. Many contain additional customizations, exploratory code, or notes added to reinforce my understanding.

## 🎟️ Acknowledgements

All instructional material and original exercise concepts come from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) — a fantastic resource maintained by Mozilla and the developer community. Huge thanks to everyone who contributes to making MDN such an accessible and valuable learning platform.
