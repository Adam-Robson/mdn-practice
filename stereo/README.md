# stereo

This project includes visualizations based on audio frequency. It uses the Web Audio API to play the audio and uses the Canvas element to for visualization. This is a project I generated for fun and for learning how to work with the various APIs available, while using TypeScript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
